            <p>
                Hello! My name is Mustafa also known as MustafaXD (because of Youtube and Discord stuff) I'm 14 year old boy who loves to code and learn
                new technologies currently I just started learning Web Developement and a personal portfolio website was the first idea that clicked my mind
                to start with so here it is, I'm not like an expert or something but I have mastered Python programming, the things I've done with Python are 
                Discord.py/Pycord for Bot Developement, PyTweet (a twitter python api wrapper) events and commands, and some much more stuff that I probably forgot:D

                If you want to work with me in any type of project that my expertise match with you are more then welcome to go to the contact page and contact me 
                right away and we can start the work then because most of the time when I'm online I code random projects and when I'm offline I'm probably doing
                school stuff, and if you want to checkout my past projects you can visit my Github profile and then take a look on my recent projects.
            </p>
